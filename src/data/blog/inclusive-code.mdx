**A sketched version** of crude beginning of my writings. This is not the first time
rather a second or the third time to have a collection of learned items as a blog.
I find lot of information when working on day to day job. Sometimes, out of curiosity
I find information that is pretty interesting.

And often, I forget and have to find the same information
again so why not make a dedicated collection of my learnings and findings in a blog.
Then, I can simply visit my own blog and find the information without having to re google it.
